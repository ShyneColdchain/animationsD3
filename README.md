============

Randomly generated Voronoi



1. starting with circle animations
2. 500 circles from random X and random Y coordinates
3. each circle has a randomly generated radius 
4. circles enlarge on 'click' relative to starting radius 
5. Voronoi diagram with interactivity

Problem with circles enlarging on click now that mouseover events for voronoi.
